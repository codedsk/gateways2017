% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig



% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
The HUBzero Platform has a long history of supporting interactive simulation tools with X11-based graphical user interfaces through the web browser. Over the last few years, new HTML and JavaScript based development environments have matured and are being utilized by researchers to help them perform research, develop simulations, clean and explore data, and present results. In this paper, we look at how the HUBzero Platform supports the use and publication of web applications built with Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio’s Shiny, and how this infrastructure is generic enough to support other web application platforms.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
 
The HUBzero platform was designed to allow simulations to run in containers with X11 graphics forwarded to the users' browsers via the VNC protocol.
This allowed existing applications to be easily deployed on the servers and run by users everywhere.  For tools and simulations without a GUI, we developed Rappture]cite{rappture}, a framework for tools providing a simple, consistent GUI running over VNC.
 
Over the last four years, advances in web technologies have helped usher in a new wave of interactivity for user interfaces built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and WebGL. Where previously, users had to push the refresh button in their web browser to check for updates to a web page or database, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML/JSON (AJAX) and HTML5 now allows those updates to be streamed back to the user’s browser, making the responses to requests more interactive. New, exciting web-based development environments, like Jupyter[cite], and by Studio's Shiny[cite], allow a more interactive, flexible way to develop content. Features like the HTML5 Canvas and WebGL have made interactive graphics and data visualization in the browser a reality.  Running visualizations in the browser is much faster and more scalable than rendering them on a remote server and viewing them through VNC.  

In order to take advantage of these new web-based applications, we made some changes to the HUBzero architecture that would allow us to do so while preserving the strengths of the existing platform. 

\section{Current Architecture}


\subsection {Tool containers}

When users launch an application on the HUBzero Platform, the application runs
in a tool container, a lightweight virtual environment implemented using
OpenVZ\cite{openvz}, running the Debian GNU/Linux operating system. These
OpenVZ based containers help provide isolation between the running instances of
applications being served by the HUB, and provides control over network and
filesystem access inside of the container.

Each user has a home directory with conventional ownership, access controls,
and quota limitations. Tools are run with the rights and privileges of the
particular user rather than a shared execution account.


\subsection {Supporting X11 based tools}

Upon initialization, each tool container starts an X Windows Server and the
display is project back into the user's web browser through Virtual Network
Computing (VNC).  Running an X Server inside of the tool container allows the
developer to choose from a variety of graphical user interface toolkits with
which to build an application. The containers support any GUI toolkit that runs
under the X Window System, including popular options like Tcl/Tk, GTk, Qt, and
WxWindows.  To aid scientists and researchers who may not have expertise in
user interface development, our team built Rappture, the Rappid APPlication
infrastrucTURE.  Rappture is a Tcl/Tk and C++ based toolkit that allows
developers to quickly assemble and attach a graphical user interface to their
science application. On HUBs like nanohub.org and pharmahub.org and
mygeohub.org, over 400 applications have been deployed using an X11-based user
interface.

%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%



\section {Supporting Web Applications}

\subsection {Jupyter Notebooks}
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more. We also plan on using it as an application development framework.

Jupyter was our first target for hub integration. There is an open-source multiuser Jupyter server, but because we wanted our users to have access to all the HUBzero features, we decided against using it, instead opting to integrate Jupyter more deeply in our architecture. We would do this by having Jupyter run in the same environment and using the same OpenVZ containers we were currently using.  

Our first problem to overcome was that our middleware talked to the containers through a custom VNC proxy.  We needed to also be supporting https and websockets.  

The second problem was authentication.  We needed to be sure only authorized users launched notebooks, and also that users could not access another user's session.

Finally, we needed a small number of changes to our middleware to understand the difference in VNC and non-VNC sessions and how to talk to the proxy in each case.



\subsection {RStudio's Shiny applications and RMarkdown documents}

For many R users, RStudio is the graphical user interface of choice when
developing analysis and reports. The desktop version of the application
provides access to an R-based integrated development environment (IDE) and is
available on all major platforms. RStudio Inc., the company behind the RStudio
IDE also makes available an Open Source web version of the application that can
be deployed on a server to provide access for multiple people at a time. While
the open source version of their IDE lacks the administrative, security, and
monitoring tools of their commercial version, it does provide many of the
features expected by users of the desktop version and can be a good replacement
for the desktop version if configured correctly.

Getting RStudio running on the hubs required very little additional work after 
the architectural changes we made for Jupyter.

\subsection {New Architecture}

\begin{figure*}[!h]

	\subfloat[Before]{\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{arch_old}%

		\label{fig_second_case}}
	\caption{Architecture Changes}
	\label{fig_sim}
\end{figure*}

On the HUB, when a user starts the a web application, the request is routed
from the user's web browser, through the HUB's webserver, front and exec
proxies, and into a tool container where an Jupyter, RStudio or other server
waits to respond.

\subsection{Integration at a deeper level}

Integrating web applications into the HUBzero Platform is more than just providing support for applications built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Web applications running inside of the tool container have access to the same resources as X11-based applications. Namely, web applications can access a user's HUB disk space, run other applications that have been published on the HUB, and can access powerful compute clusters through Submit[cite].

\section {Examples}

This same mechanism is used to support applications built using Shiny,
RStudio's library for building web applications from within R, and RMarkdown
documents. Like the RStudio IDE, Shiny applications and RMarkdown documents
require a web server to be running in the tool container to field requests from
the user's web browser. By themselves, static HTML documents with CSS and JavaScript
can also be served from within a tool container, but there is less of a need
for the isolation and security features provided by the tool container.

%%FIXME: add citations and examples of published rstudio apps.


\subsection {Wt}

The changes made to the HUBzero Platform to support web applications are not
specific to supporting Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio's Shiny and RMarkdown
based applications and documents.
